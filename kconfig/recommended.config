# The following are the Brillo kernel configurations that are recommended
# (though not strictly required) for all kernel builds. These can be
# overridden by setting TARGET_KERNEL_CONFIGS.
#

# If building an old Android-patched kernel tree, append DTB to image.
CONFIG_BUILD_ARM_APPENDED_DTB_IMAGE=y

# Building a monolithic kernel is highly recommended since it removes the
# kernel module attack surface entirely.

# It's extremely handy to have a serial port available for debugging.
CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_FTDI_SIO=y
CONFIG_USB_SERIAL=y
