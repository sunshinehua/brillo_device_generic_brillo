# This file contains the Brillo kernel configurations that are recommended
# (though not strictly required) for all kernel builds.

# Building a monolithic kernel is highly recommended since it removes the
# kernel module attack surface entirely.
# CONFIG_MODULES is not set

# It's extremely handy to have a serial port available for debugging.
